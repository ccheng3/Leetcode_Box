Be present
Attendance at all sessions is mandatory.
All students are allowed up to 3 absences throughout the entire program. Students do not need to submit a request to use these absences.
We check attendance multiple times throughout a class session and may mark you as absent if you are missing for the majority of a session.
Students who are absent must still submit the coursework for a unit by the posted deadline.

üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Participate.
Students are expected to actively attend and participate in each session.
Camera and microphone usage is required as part of active participation.
During lecture and independent work time, we strongly encourage students to turn their cameras on to increase focus and participation.
During any group work time, students are required to have their cameras on and verbally respond during breakout room sessions in order to collaborate with their peers, build relationships, and practice professionalism. If students do not have their cameras on during group work portions of class, they may be marked absent.
